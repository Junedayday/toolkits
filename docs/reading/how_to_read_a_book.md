2.  Inspectional Reading
3.  Analytical Reading
4.  Syntopical Reading



## 4 Stages of Elementary Reading

1. Reading Readiness
2. Word Mastery
3. Vocabulary Growth and the Utilization of Context
4. Mature Reader - Refinement and Enhancement of the Skills



## Inspectional Reading

- Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading

  1. Title Page / Preface
  2. Table of Contents
  3. Index
  4. Publisher’s Blurb
  5. Pivotal Chapters
  6. Any Chapters

- Superficial Reading

  `In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.`



## 4 Basic Questions for Active Reading

1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail, and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?



## Analytical Reading

- 1st Stage - Finding what a book is about

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.

- 2nd Stage - Finding what a book says

5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.
6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.
7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.

- 3rd Stage - Criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge
- General maxims of intellectual etiquette

9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”)
10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.

- Special criteria for points of criticism

12. Show wherein the author is uninformed.
13. Show wherein the author is misinformed.
14. Show wherein the author is illogical.
15. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete.



## Syntopical Reading

- Surveying the field preparatory to syntopical reading

1. Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books.
2. Inspect all of the books on the tentative bibliography to ascertain which are germane to your subject, and also to acquire a clearer idea of the subject.

Note: These two steps are not, strictly speaking, chronologically distinct; that is, the two steps have an effect on each other, with the second, in particular, serving to modify the first.

- Syntopical reading of the bibliography amassed in stage 1

1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage 1 in order to find the most relevant passages.
2. Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted as employing , whether they actually employ the words or not.
3. Establish a set of neutral propositions for all the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.
4. Define th issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that is sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors’ views on matters that may not have been their primary concern.
5. Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated.

Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to insure this is always to accompany an interpretation of an author’s views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text.
